> "... light of my life."

[The Lox Programming Language](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) implemented in Rust.

Ported from the original Java implementation `jlox`, but with no visitor patterns, no `null` values, no subclasses and implicit conversions, just pure `enum`s.

~~`Gc<T>` is a necessary evil...~~
